## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, kind, or a managed cluster like EKS, AKS, or GKE).
- `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your cluster.
- Helm (for package management).
- Access to cloud provider credentials (AWS, Azure, GCP) if using managed services.
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes concepts (e.g., pods, deployments, services).

### General Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kubernetes-ecosystem.git
   cd kubernetes-ecosystem
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Specific Directory**:
   Each directory contains its own setup instructions. For example:

   - To set up a Kubernetes cluster with `kubeadm`, navigate to `kubernetes-cluster-installation/kubeadm` and follow the instructions in `installation.sh`.
   - To deploy a monitoring stack, navigate to `monitoring-and-observability/EFK-Stack` and follow `install.md`.

3. **Apply Configurations**:
   Most directories contain YAML manifests or shell scripts. Apply them using `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml
   ```

4. **Follow Specific Instructions**:
   Each directory includes a `README.md` or similar documentation with detailed setup steps. For example:
   - `WASM/k8s/enableWASMOnAKS.md` provides instructions for enabling WebAssembly on Azure AKS.
   - `security/kubescape/install.md` guides you through installing Kubescape for security scanning.
